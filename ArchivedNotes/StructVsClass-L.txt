The only difference between struct and class is 
    struct: everything is public by default
    class: everything is private by default
    
The C-struct can be initialized by uniform initialization.
    C-struct:
        1. Only member variables.
        2. All the members as public.
        If anything else is defined, then it no longer remains a C-struct (Use the OOP concepts in that case)


///////////////////////////// Old way of thinking ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Pure struct:
	It has no constructor defined.
	If no constructor is defined it has -Default Constructor -Copy constructor [Do not confuse uniform initialization as Parameterized constr]
	If any constructor is defined, the behaviour becomes similar to class that is :
		-Default constructor if no constructor is defined
		-If any constructor is defined, then no default constructor
		-No default parameterized constructor is defined
